# Research

## Supervision

I am preparing capstone projects for the [Master of Data Science](https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/graduate/master-of-data-science/) that build on data, methods, and outcomes from the research projects described below.

## Project: Near-real-time epidemic forecasting

This project combines mathematical/computational models of infectious disease epidemics with near-real-time surveillance data and other supporting data streams, in order to predict future disease activity.
**A key challenge is deciding how to interpret incomplete data.**
Publications arising from this project include:

- [Forecasting COVID-19 activity in Australia to support pandemic response: May to October 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35668-6), Moss et al., 2023.

- [Early analysis of the Australian COVID-19 epidemic](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58785), Price et al., 2020.

- [Forecasting influenza outbreak dynamics in Melbourne from Internet search query surveillance data](https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12376), Moss et al., 2016.

## Project: Informing pandemic preparedness and response plans

This project uses mathematical/computational models of infectious disease epidemics to assess the impact of public health interventions and how available resources (such as antiviral drugs and vaccines) might best be used.
**A key challenge is defining what "best" actually means.**
Publications arising from this project include:

- [Constructing an ethical framework for priority allocation of pandemic vaccines](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.12.053), Sullivan et al., 2021.

- [Priority allocation of pandemic influenza vaccines in Australia - recommendations of 3 Community Juries](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.12.010), Degeling et al., 2021.

- [Reducing disease burden in an influenza pandemic by targeted delivery of neuraminidase inhibitors: mathematical models in the Australian context](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-016-1866-7), Moss et al., 2016.

- [Model-informed risk assessment and decision making for an emerging infectious disease in the Asia-Pacific region](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005018), Moss et al., 2016.

- [Diagnosis and Antiviral Intervention Strategies for Mitigating an Influenza Epidemic](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014505), Moss et al., 2011.

## Project: Supporting response policy decision-making

This project links interpretation of near-real-time surveillance data to actions and decisions that are articulated in pandemic preparedness and response plans.
**A key challenge is appropriately accounting for, and communicating, uncertainty without causing decision paralysis.**
Publications arising from this project include:

- [Development of an influenza pandemic decision support tool linking situational analytics to national response policy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2021.100478), Shearer et al., 2021.

- [Infectious disease pandemic planning and response: Incorporating decision analysis](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003018), Shearer et al., 2020.
