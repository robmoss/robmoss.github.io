My article "[Hormonal regulation of salt and water excretion: a mathematical
model of whole-kidney function and
pressure-natriuresis](http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.00089.2013)" (a
collaboration with S.&nbsp;Randall Thomas), has been published in *AJP Renal*.
It was also selected as the subject for an **Editorial Focus essay**,
"[Advancement in integrated models of renal function: closing the gap between
simulation and real life](http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.00560.2013)",
written by Branko Braam.

We present a whole-kidney model that incorporates glomerular and tubular
function, differentiates cortical and medullary function, and describes
vascular and reabsorptive characteristics of the kidney.
Model simulations explore the regulation of renal function by aldosterone,
angiotensin II, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH), and also the inhibition of
sodium reabsorption in response to the administration of a thiazide and of
amiloride.
This model of integrated renal function is quite successful in simulating
renal function, although there are of course several caveats.
The article also provides a broad survey of both renal modelling and the
experimental literature.

In addition to the manuscript itself, [interactive versions](/models) of a key
figure&mdash;a comparison of model excretion rates against data from a number
of experimental studies of acute pressure natriuresis in the rat&mdash;allow
the viewer to examine each data series in isolation and refer back to the
original articles.
