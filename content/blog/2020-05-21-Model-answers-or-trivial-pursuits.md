I've had a number of occasions to use my [stochastic SIR
demo](https://robmoss.github.io/sir-demo/) since I first tested it out on a
[Melbourne Maths and Science Meetup](@/blog/2019-02-28-Melbourne-Maths-and-Science-Meetup.md) audience, including last
year's *Communicable Diseases Control Conference* in Canberra.
I used it most recently in our school seminar on Wednesday 11 March, for which
Jodie McVernon chose the title *Model answers or trivial pursuits? Using
epidemiological models to support COVID-19 preparedness and response*.
Jodie, Freya Shearer, and I talked about collaborative modelling efforts to
better understand the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19, and how we
had been using models to help identify effective and proportionate measures
for health sector and whole-of-society responses.
What a way to welcome our new head of school, [Nancy
Baxter](https://twitter.com/enenbee)!

There's been a huge amount of work done to date, by an ever-expanding network
of collaborators.
It has been genuinely rewarding to play a role in national and international
efforts to respond to COVID-19, but it's also been extremely stressful and
exhausting.
And it's been terrifying to be intimately aware that my work is feeding into
decision-making at the highest levels of government in the midst of an
emerging global crisis.
I am keenly looking forward to the day where our physical distancing measures
have been relaxed and, in the company of close friends, I can look back at
this time as something that happened to all of us.
