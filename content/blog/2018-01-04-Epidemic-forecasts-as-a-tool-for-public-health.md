Infectious disease forecasting has been a very active research area in the
past few years, and these methods have the potential to provide valuable
decision-support capabilities for public health staff.
There are many challenges that must be surmounted before this can be realised,
and one major gap in the literature is operational research in pilot,
real-world applications.
We report on exactly this kind of study in our most recent forecasting paper,
"[Epidemic forecasts as a tool for public health: interpretation and
(re)calibration](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.12750)", which has just
been made available online and will appear in an upcoming issue of the
*Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health*.
