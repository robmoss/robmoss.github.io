For me, the choice of platform came down to <a
href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> or <a
href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>. I am aware of <a
href="http://sagemath.org/">Sage</a>, but it seemed like such a huge and
sprawling collection that I found it a little off-putting (and I suspect it
greatly exceeds my needs). In the end, I chose <strong>R</strong> because I
had (very limited) experience with it, and I figured I'd enjoy using a
statistical language more than a general-purpose language for this kind of
work. That's not to say I didn't get thoroughly confused at times, of course.
I found the following R packages and documentation very useful:

<ul>

<li>
The <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html">R manuals</a> and <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/faqs.html">FAQs</a> are a good place to start.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/">ggplot2</a> is a very flexible (and
pretty!) graphing package.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://rocr.bioinf.mpi-sb.mpg.de/">ROCR</a> is a visualisation
package for evaluating classifiers (e.g., <acronym title="generalized linear
model">GLM</acronym>s).
</li>

<li>
Writing R Extensions (in <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html">html</a> and <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.pdf">pdf</a>) describes how
to write your own packages (such as my <a
href="https://github.com/rma/rma.g92">clumsy attempt</a> as part of a
sensitivity analysis of the Guyton model).
</li>

<li>
If you're having difficulties, the <a href="http://www.burns-
stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf">R Inferno</a> may be useful (from the
preface: <em>"If you are using R and you think you're in hell, this is a map
for you"</em>).
</li>

<li>
The R community has recently started a <a
href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/R_Programming">wiki book</a>, whose
sections are currently in varying stages of completeness.
</li>

</ul>

In addition, there are several other tools that can be very handy at certain
times:

<ul>

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/pn2200/g3data">g3data</a> is an
<strong>excellent</strong> tool for extracting data points from published
graphs.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://ggobi.org/">GGobi</a> is a visualisation tool for exploring
high-dimensional data.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://stats.math.uni-augsburg.de/Mondrian/">Mondrian</a> is an
interactive data visualisation tool.
</li>

</ul>

But despite all the time I've spent with R and other statistical tools, I'm
still very much aware that I am a complete novice when it comes to statistics.
I really need to start reading some good foundational texts, although I always
ended up digging through the proofs and derivations because I'm rarely
comfortable unless I'm convinced I understand the <em>how</em> and the
<em>why</em>.
