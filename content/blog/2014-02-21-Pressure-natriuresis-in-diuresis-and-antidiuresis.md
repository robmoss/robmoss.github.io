"[Dominant factors that govern pressure natriuresis in diuresis and
antidiuresis: a mathematical
model](http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.00500.2013)"
(a collaboration with Anita T.&nbsp;Layton) has been accepted by *AJP Renal*
and is now available online in advance of final publication.

Building on observations in [my previous modelling
study](@/blog/2014-01-15-Hormonal-regulation-of-salt-and-water-excretion.md),
we investigated how pressure natriuresis—in both diuresis and
antidiuresis—can be influenced by changes in medullary blood flow
autoregulation and by inhibition of transport in the proximal convoluted
tubule (PCT).
We found that inhibited reabsorption in the model PCT (to degrees consistent
with experimental measurements) is sufficient to stimulate a pressure
natriuresis.

The challenge here is that there is insufficient experimental data to
quantify the pressure-dependent reabsorption inhibition in the PCT, but it
is precisely this response that appears to play the single largest role in
driving pressure natriuresis.
Our modelling study establishes a reasonable benchmark for this quantitative
relationship, which can be applied to future whole-kidney models.
