In "[Cardiorenal Syndrome: An Evolutionary Point of
View](http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.188706)",
Ito makes a number of very interesting observations about the evolutionary
history of the mammalian kidney, and potential implications this might have
for our organs' ability to cope with high salt intake, obesity, and a
sedentary lifestyle.
A teleological perspective of the renal architecture is also introduced, and
serves to illustrate hypotheses concerning the localisation of vascular damage
("*strain vessels*") and ischemic injuries.
Finally, the article is exceptionally concise and clear, without sacrificing
detail for brevity.
