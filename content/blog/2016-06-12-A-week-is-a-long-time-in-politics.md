A year has passed since my [last post](@/blog/2015-06-12-Virtual-model-environment.md), and much has happened.
I contributed to 6 government reports, submitted 5 first-author papers, became
a reviewer for 4 more journals, gave 3 talks about our influenza forecasting
project, enrolled 2 jurisdictions in our forecasting project, and
joined 1 surveillance system.
Here is the 2015/16 financial year recap &hellip;

<!-- more -->

+ I gave a talk about our influenza forecasting methods to the [Qualitative
  and Applied Ecology Group](https://qaeco.com/) here at the University of
  Melbourne in June 2015 (a great group, lots of fun).
+ As part of a solicited tender for the Commonwealth Office of Health
  Protection, I contributed to two government reports that were submitted in
  June and August.
+ I presented our influenza forecasting project to the
  [CDNA](http://www.health.gov.au/cdna) Jurisdictional Executive Group in
  July.
+ I presented a grant proposal at the CEB Grant Retreat in October.
+ I participated in the *"Improving communications of scientific results for
  policy makers"* workshop in Canberra in October.
+ I was invited to present our influenza forecasting project at the National
  Influenza Surveillance Committee meeting in November.
  As a result, several other jurisdictions are now participating!
+ I received [PRISM](http://prism.edu.au/) travel funding to present a poster
  at [Epidemics<sup>5</sup>](http://www.epidemics.elsevier.com/) in December,
  where I met lots of interesting people, had lots of discussions about
  disease forecasting, and spent an extra day in Los Angeles on the way home
  thanks to a faulty aeroplane.
+ I gave a talk at [ISIRV 2016](https://isirv2016.influenza.hk/) in January
  2016, met even more interesting people, spent a week in [Simon Cauchemez's
lab](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/mathematical-modelling-of-infectious-diseases/),
  and practised my French with friends and colleagues from my CNRS days.
+ I commenced an appointment as an *academic convenor* for the [Data, Systems
  and Society Research Network](http://data-research.unimelb.edu.au/) in
  February.
+ Our first influenza forecasting paper was
  [published in IORV](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/irv.12376) in March.
+ As part of ongoing solicited tenders with the Commonwealth Office of Health
  Protection, I contributed to two *phase 1* government reports submitted in
  April and two *phase 2* government reports submitted in May.
  *Phase 3* reports will follow.
+ We began providing live
  [flu forecasts](http://mathmodelling.sph.unimelb.edu.au/~rgm/flu-forecasts/)
  for **six cities** in May.
+ I began participating in [Flutracking](http://www.flutracking.net/) in May.
  You should consider [joining](http://www.flutracking.net/?inv2f) too!
+ Our forecasting toolkit is built on top of our generic particle filter
  package [pypfilt](https://pypfilt.readthedocs.io) and our infectious disease
  forecasting package [epifx](https://epifx.readthedocs.io/), both of which
  are written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and are now available under
  **permissive licenses**.
+ I reviewed papers for Eurosurveillance,
  [Involve](http://msp.org/involve/about/journal/about.html), PLOS Comp Biol,
  and the Journal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics.
+ I attended other great meetings, including the 2015 Influenza Program Annual
  Retreat and the PRISM Training and Knowledge Transfer Conference (where I
  was a judge for the PhD student competition).
+ Submitted 5 first-author papers (1 published so far, see above).
+ Supervised an MSci(Epi) student to completion.
+ Officially named as a co-supervisor for
  [Alex Zarebski](http://prism.edu.au/staff/alex-zarebski/).
