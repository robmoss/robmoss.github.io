Two firsts in one: "[Model selection for seasonal influenza
forecasting](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2016.12.004)"
is [Alex](http://prism.edu.au/staff/alex-zarebski/)'s first **first-author**
and my first **last-author** paper.
It will appear in an upcoming issue of *Infectious Disease Modelling*, a new
open access journal with a focus on the interface between mathematical
modelling, data analysis, and public health decision support.

This paper presents a likelihood-based method for selecting models that best
predict future data (when conditioned on past data), and uses it to evaluate
the predictive skill of disease transmission models that incorporate various
features, such as inhomogeneous population mixing and climatic effects on
transmission.
I won't say any more here; if you're interested, read the paper!
