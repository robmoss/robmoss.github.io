This paper caught my eye a while back: <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article
/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0010068">"Positive" Results Increase Down
the Hierarchy of the Sciences</a> (2010). To quote the abstract:

<blockquote>
If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in "softer" sciences
should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and
therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at
all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly
defined.
</blockquote>

I wonder where the authors would classify this work on the soft/hard scale?
