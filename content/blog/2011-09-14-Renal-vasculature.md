Bearing the plain title of <a
href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cphy.cp020306/abstract">Renal
Circulation</a> (2011), this review article provides great detail about renal
microcirculation and autoregulation. It's probably just as useful for the
references as for the actual content.

<strong>Update:</strong> I didn't realise that this is a chapter from
<em>Handbook of Physiology</em> that is now available as part of <a
href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/cphy">Comprehensive
Physiology</a>, and that this body of work is being <a
href="http://www.comprehensivephysiology.com/">regularly updated</a>.
