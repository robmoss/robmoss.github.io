Our first trial of *live* influenza forecasting for metropolitan Melbourne is
now available
[online](http://mathmodelling.sph.unimelb.edu.au/~rgm/flu-forecasts/), using
publicly available [surveillance data](http://ideas.health.vic.gov.au/).
It will be very exciting to see how the forecasts evolve in the coming months!

And yes, the animated plots are built with `D3.js`.
