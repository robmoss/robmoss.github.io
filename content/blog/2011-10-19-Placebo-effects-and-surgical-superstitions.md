It's funny how the mind works. The placebo effect remains an unknowable
mystery, where the body somehow compensates for an expected effect <em>even in
cases where the subject is aware</em> that they are receiving a placebo. On an
equally mysterious topic, I was deeply surprised when I first discovered the
serious consideration with which some bizarre superstitions were treated in
the healthcare field.

<li>
<a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa013259">A controlled trial
of arthroscopic surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee</a> (2002) shows that a
placebo effect exists for osteoarthritic patients who undergo (<em>or
don't</em>) arthroscopic surgery of the knee to relieve pain and improve knee
function.

<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0736-4679(01)00496-6">The moon and the
stones. Can the moonâ€™s attractive forces cause renal colic?</a> (2002) The
answer is cautious: "The forces are negligible and not strong enough to be a
physiological stimulus and cause renal colic. We are aware that our study at
this point, because it was performed with a limited number of patients, can
not be significant."

<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11255-006-9165-7">Lunar phases and zodiac
signs do not influence quality of radical cystectomy&mdash;a statistical
analysis of 452 patients with invasive bladder cancer </a> (2007) presents a
much larger study and state: "Although this was not a prospective randomized
trial, the statistical magnitude of the results do not support any
recommendations for scheduling patients for radical cystectomy at any
particular day of the lunar phase."

<li>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00268-011-1166-8">Popular belief meets
surgical reality: impact of lunar phases, Friday the 13th and zodiac signs on
emergency operations and intraoperative blood loss</a> (2011) couches the
conclusion more emphatically: "Scientific analysis of our data does not
support the belief that moon phases, zodiac signs, or Friday 13th influence
surgical blood loss and emergency frequency. Our data indicate that such
beliefs are myths far beyond reality." But in a move that cynical observers
might suggest stems from a desire for continued funding, they end with: "So
far, however, studies with adequate power and sample size calculation
rejecting any association between superstition and medicine are
under-represented in the medical literature."
