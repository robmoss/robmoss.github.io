Juxta-medullary nephrons are consistently found to have higher filtration
rates than superficial nephrons. Is this due to the underlying anatomy of the
cortical radial artery, from which the juxta-medullary afferent arterioles
branch before the superficial arterioles? Is it due to anatomical differences
in the glomeruli, such as length, surface area or permeability? Or is it
perhaps a matter of differences in the regulation of glomerular blood flow?

Due in part to the physical difficulty of observing juxta-medullary glomeruli
without damaging the kidney, this is not an easy question to answer. And
indeed, I have been unable to find any experimental results that directly
address this issue. The most relevant papers that I have been able to find
detail studies of the filtration rates in superficial and juxta-medullary
nephrons, without investigation of the underlying cause(s).

<li>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ki.1972.30">Glomerular filtration in single
nephrons</a> (Wright and Giebisch, 1972) is a great review article with a
wealth of references to experimental data. Perhaps the most pertinent sentence
is: <em>"At this time, therefore, a role for redistribution of SNGFR within
the kidney during natriuretic states is not established. Natriuresis can occur
without redistribution; however, the disproportionate increases in superficial
SNGFR seen in some rat experiments seem to be real changes."</em>

<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ph.39.030177.001111">Heterogeneity
of Nephron Function</a> (1977) is another great review article with a lot of
useful data and critical evaluations of a wide range of experimental studies.
They make a key observation: <em>"In addition, all direct measurements of
juxta-medullary nephron SNGFR have been obtained from young rats or desert
rodents since the extrarenal part of the papilla is more readily accessi­ble
to micropuncture in the immature animal than in the adult. Whether these
values are similar in adult rats has been evaluated with more indirect
estimates of SNGFR."</em>

<li>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ki.1990.271">Glomerular blood flow</a>

<strong>Table 3B</strong>).

The companion article, <a
href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00586557">Functional Heterogeneity of
Nephrons I. Intraluminal Flow Velocities</a> (1969) is also interesting, and
points to yet another interesting study: <a

factors in congestive heart failure</a> (1966).
</li>

</ul>

The (non-definitive) answer seems to be that redistribution of SNGFR is rarely
and inconsistently observed in adult models, and so the safest modelling
assumption is to assume a constant (or near-constant) ratio of juxta-medullary
to superficial SNGFR in the range 1.5&ndash;2.0.

and deep cortex include:

filtration rate in the hypothyroid animals is not caused by a decrease in the

juxtamedullary to superficial nephrons."</em>

redistribution: <em>"Total kidney GFR did not change after both substances,

ones and the ratio SGFR superficial nephrons/SGFR juxtamedullary nephrons
which was 0.7 in the normal rats reached 1.0 in the salt-loaded rats,
indicating that there was no more functional heterogeneity of nephrons during
our salt loadings."</em> This variation is compared to the sodium-dependent
intra-renal distribution of renin that has been observed in other studies.
