*"It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future"* — this
[famous quote](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/10/20/no-predict/) is a
great opening line when discussing infectious disease forecasting.
I used it in my talk at the Australian Influenza Symposium (1-2 Nov 2017), as
did a speaker in an earlier session.
And there are *many reasons* why infectious disease forecasting is hard.
There isn't a single-biggest roadblock to making accurate epidemic forecasts,
and I was recently quoted about this very matter in "[How Bad Will the Flu
Season Get? Forecasters Are Competing to Figure it
Out](https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/51042/)" (*The
Scientist*, 28 Nov 2017).

I really enjoy the challenge of engaging with non-academic audiences, both as
an end in itself, and also because it should help me improve my grant writing.
And this isn't my first experience with the media.
I've previously been quoted in articles about the link between climate and
influenza transmission ([Flu outbreaks are subject to humidity — not just
heat](https://cosmosmagazine.com/climate/hot-and-wet-or-cold-and-dry-both-boost-flu-in-the-tropics),
*Cosmos*, 1 Nov 2016), and our collaboration with the Victorian Department of
Health and Human Services ([Defence scientists' bio attack detector could
predict flu
outbreaks](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/defence-scientists-bio-attack-detector-could-predict-flu-outbreaks/news-story/129411a1edf0aa01fcb84c0ecf088bb4),
*Herald Sun*, 14 Jul 2016).
