Alex Lee and I are the joint winners of the [2024 Venables Award](https://statsocaus.github.io/venables-award/) for new developers of open source software for data analytics!
My submission was [pypfilt](https://pypfilt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), my Python package that implements various particle filter methods.
Alex Lee's submission was [whereabouts](https://whereabouts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python package for bulk geocoding and address standardisation.

This award is judged by the [Statistical Computing and Visualisation](https://statsoc.org.au/Statistical-Computing-and-Visualisation-Section) section of the [Statistical Society of Australia](https://statsoc.org.au/), and sponsored by the [Australian Research Data Commons](http://ardc.edu.au/).
Later this year we'll both appear in the ARDC's [Shaping Research Software](https://ardc.edu.au/news-and-events/news/?_keyword=%22Shaping%20Research%20Software%22&_categories=research-software) article series, and showcase our software packages in an SSA seminar.

It's a thrilling surprise and genuine honour to win this award.
I'm looking forward to sharing thoughts and reflections on [pypfilt](https://pypfilt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and research software engineering in general, and in hearing about Alex Lee's work.

My biggest hope is that other people will find [pypfilt](https://pypfilt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) useful for their own work ü§ûüèº
