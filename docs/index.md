## :ardis-pathogen: Research

[My research](projects.md) focuses on predicting and mitigating the burden of infectious disease epidemics, through the use of mathematical/computational modelling and Bayesian inference.
My primary focus is on seasonal and pandemic influenza, other respiratory pathogens such as RSV and COVID-19, and malaria.
This includes:

- Using **scenario modelling to inform recommendations** for effective health interventions; and
- Synthesising models and surveillance data to generate **near-real-time epidemic forecasts**.

I am a proponent of [Reproducible Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility), [Open Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access), and [Free and Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), and produce open source software packages through my research activities.
See my [Software](software.md) page for details.
