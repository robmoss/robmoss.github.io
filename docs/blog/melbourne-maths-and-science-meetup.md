Last night I gave a talk about *Mathematical models of infectious disease
transmission* ([slides](https://bitbucket.org/robmoss/talk-2019-02-mmsm/)) at
the
[Melbourne Maths and Science Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/The-Melbourne-Maths-and-Science-Meetup/events/258523294/).
I used my [stochastic SIR demo](https://robmoss.github.io/sir-demo/)
to simulate disease outbreaks amongst the audience — each audience member
was assigned a unique number and had to stand up while they were infectious
— and it's definitely something I'd like to try in a classroom setting.
I was asked very good and challenging questions throughout the talk, and on
several occasions my reply was "that's a great question, and I'll talk about
that a bit later on".
It was a fun night and a chance to meet some great people!
Now I'm looking forward to being in the audience at their next event.
