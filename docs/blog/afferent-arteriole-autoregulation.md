In a [recent modelling study](pressure-natriuresis-in-diuresis-and-antidiuresis.md) we extended an existing model of afferent arteriole autoregulation (originally presented by [Feldberg et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7485545)) by adding an explicit glomerulus and calculating model SNGFR in addition to afferent blood and plasma flows.

See [this description](../models.md) of our extensions, the updated model equations, and a number of plots.
