In thinking about the strengths and limitations of different surveillance
systems — from the perspective of infectious disease forecasting in my case,
but the point applies more generally — it becomes clear that there is
[no silver bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet).
No one surveillance system will tell us everything we need to know in order to
understand the current impact of a disease on a population, or to predict the
future impact of a disease.
The [surveillance pyramid](https://www.cdc.gov/foodnet/surveillance.html)
model illustrates this in a very nice and clear manner:

There is a sequence of events that must occur, and conditions that must be
met, in order for someone to become visible to a surveillance system.
This sequence proceeds in order from the bottom to the top of the pyramid.

1. Firstly, they must be susceptible to infection!
2. They must be exposed to the pathogen and become infected.
3. They must then develop symptoms; this can depend on factors such as their *immune status*, *co-morbidities*, and so on.
4. The symptoms must be sufficiently severe that they *choose* to seek health
   care. If the symptoms are particularly severe, it may purely be a matter of
   having access to health care.
5. The clinician must then *choose* to collect a specimen for testing.
6. The specimen must be viable (which can depend on how it was collected, and
   on how long it has taken the patient to seek health care) and produce a
   positive test result.
7. This positive result must then be reported in an accurate and timely
   manner.

Every one of the above events filters out more and more of the infected
individuals, and so the end result is better thought of as the tip of a much
larger "iceberg" of disease.

**Figure 2:** we should really think of this as an iceberg.

And, even more important than this matter of the visible proportion, is the
fact that *biological*, *immunological*, and *behavioural* factors determine
which individuals are visible to this system.
These layers also sit between the quantities that are explicitly represented
in mathematical models of infection (at the bottom of the pyramid), and the
disease surveillance data (at the top of the pyramid).

**Figure 3:** there are complex *biological*, *immunological*, and *behavioural* layers that sit between the quantities we explicitly represent in mathematical models of infection (at the bottom), and the disease surveillance data (at the top).

These factors are subject to unknown biases that can vary markedly over time.
The behavioural factors are also subject to conscious and unconscious biases
and are surely influenced by external factors such as media coverage and peer
opinion.
Changes in any of these factors, *independent* of any change in disease
incidence or prevalence, will affect the surveillance data.
And this is the *critical point*.

**No matter how good your surveillance system is, the data it obtains are
heavily influenced by external factors that are themselves subject to complex
and unknown dynamics.**

In other words, there is no silver bullet.
We need *multiple types* of data to give us an idea about what is happening in
each layer of the surveillance pyramid, if we are to accurately interpret our
surveillance systems and truly understand the burden of disease.

**P.S.** I am *not* the first person to think about disease surveillance in
this way and come to these conclusions!
But I did have fun talking about this problem at the
[12th Australian Influenza Symposium](https://www.influenzacentre.org/news_symposium.htm).
