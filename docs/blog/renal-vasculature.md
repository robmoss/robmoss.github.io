Bearing the plain title of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/cphy.cp020306">Renal Circulation</a> (2011), this review article provides great detail about renal microcirculation and autoregulation.
It's probably just as useful for the references as for the actual content.

<strong>Update:</strong> I didn't realise that this is a chapter from <em>Handbook of Physiology</em> that is now available as part of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/cphy">Comprehensive Physiology</a>, and that this body of work is being <a href="https://www.comprehensivephysiology.com/">regularly updated</a>.
