    <p>A year has passed since my <a href="https://robmoss.github.io/blog/virtual-model-environment/">last post</a>, and much has happened.
I contributed to 6 government reports, submitted 5 first-author papers, became
a reviewer for 4 more journals, gave 3 talks about our influenza forecasting
project, enrolled 2 jurisdictions in our forecasting project, and
joined 1 surveillance system.
Here is the 2015/16 financial year recap …</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<ul>
<li>I gave a talk about our influenza forecasting methods to the <a href="https://qaeco.com/">Qualitative
and Applied Ecology Group</a> here at the University of
Melbourne in June 2015 (a great group, lots of fun).</li>
<li>As part of a solicited tender for the Commonwealth Office of Health
Protection, I contributed to two government reports that were submitted in
June and August.</li>
<li>I presented our influenza forecasting project to the
<a href="http://www.health.gov.au/cdna">CDNA</a> Jurisdictional Executive Group in
July.</li>
<li>I presented a grant proposal at the CEB Grant Retreat in October.</li>
<li>I participated in the <em>&quot;Improving communications of scientific results for
policy makers&quot;</em> workshop in Canberra in October.</li>
<li>I was invited to present our influenza forecasting project at the National
Influenza Surveillance Committee meeting in November.
As a result, several other jurisdictions are now participating!</li>
<li>I received <a href="http://prism.edu.au/">PRISM</a> travel funding to present a poster
at <a href="http://www.epidemics.elsevier.com/">Epidemics<sup>5</sup></a> in December,
where I met lots of interesting people, had lots of discussions about
disease forecasting, and spent an extra day in Los Angeles on the way home
thanks to a faulty aeroplane.</li>
<li>I gave a talk at <a href="https://isirv2016.influenza.hk/">ISIRV 2016</a> in January
2016, met even more interesting people, spent a week in <a href="https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/mathematical-modelling-of-infectious-diseases/">Simon Cauchemez's
lab</a>,
and practised my French with friends and colleagues from my CNRS days.</li>
<li>I commenced an appointment as an <em>academic convenor</em> for the <a href="http://data-research.unimelb.edu.au/">Data, Systems
and Society Research Network</a> in
February.</li>
<li>Our first influenza forecasting paper was
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/irv.12376">published in IORV</a> in March.</li>
<li>As part of ongoing solicited tenders with the Commonwealth Office of Health
Protection, I contributed to two <em>phase 1</em> government reports submitted in
April and two <em>phase 2</em> government reports submitted in May.
<em>Phase 3</em> reports will follow.</li>
<li>We began providing live
<a href="http://mathmodelling.sph.unimelb.edu.au/~rgm/flu-forecasts/">flu forecasts</a>
for <strong>six cities</strong> in May.</li>
<li>I began participating in <a href="http://www.flutracking.net/">Flutracking</a> in May.
You should consider <a href="http://www.flutracking.net/?inv2f">joining</a> too!</li>
<li>Our forecasting toolkit is built on top of our generic particle filter
package <a href="https://pypfilt.readthedocs.io">pypfilt</a> and our infectious disease
forecasting package <a href="https://epifx.readthedocs.io/">epifx</a>, both of which
are written in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and are now available under
<strong>permissive licenses</strong>.</li>
<li>I reviewed papers for Eurosurveillance,
<a href="http://msp.org/involve/about/journal/about.html">Involve</a>, PLOS Comp Biol,
and the Journal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics.</li>
<li>I attended other great meetings, including the 2015 Influenza Program Annual
Retreat and the PRISM Training and Knowledge Transfer Conference (where I
was a judge for the PhD student competition).</li>
<li>Submitted 5 first-author papers (1 published so far, see above).</li>
<li>Supervised an MSci(Epi) student to completion.</li>
<li>Officially named as a co-supervisor for

report that requires no amendments or modifications from HR staff</em>.</li>
