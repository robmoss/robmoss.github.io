  <h1>R Markdown: hide code blocks</h1>

    <p>In writing an R Markdown document to describe a within-host malaria model that I'm working on, I have focused on the HTML version of the document and made use of <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/fold-show.html">code folding</a> to hide several code blocks by default.</p>
<p>The PDF version of the document includes the complete listing of each code block, but I instead wanted to remove the folded code blocks from the PDF version.
And while it took me a long time to find a solution, the solution itself is quite simple.</p>

    <p>In writing an R Markdown document to describe a within-host malaria model that I'm working on, I discovered that <code>knitr::read_chunk()</code> only accepts fixed line numbers and <code># ---- some-label</code> marker comments.
So I've implemented <code>read_function_chunks()</code>, below, which extracts <strong>each top-level function</strong> as a separate chunk, and supports including roxygen documentation comments.</p>

    <p>It's surprising how often you can translate one problem into another problem, for which there are known solutions and/or algorithms.
For example, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem">Green's theorem</a> you can choose between solving a line integral or a double integral, and select whichever option is simplest to solve.
The necessary ingredients are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Being aware of the equivalence between two problems; and</li>
<li>Knowing how to solve (at least) one of these problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>One example that I found (by accident) was that preserving the connectivity of all placed tokens when upgrading a tile in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18XX">18XX board game</a> is equivalent to solving a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem">maximum flow problem</a>.</p>

    <p>I've had a number of occasions to use my <a href="https://robmoss.github.io/sir-demo/">stochastic SIR
demo</a> since I first tested it out on a
<a href="https://robmoss.github.io/blog/melbourne-maths-and-science-meetup/">Melbourne Maths and Science Meetup</a> audience, including last
year's <em>Communicable Diseases Control Conference</em> in Canberra.
I used it most recently in our school seminar on Wednesday 11 March, for which
Jodie McVernon chose the title <em>Model answers or trivial pursuits? Using
epidemiological models to support COVID-19 preparedness and response</em>.
Jodie, Freya Shearer, and I talked about collaborative modelling efforts to
better understand the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19, and how we
had been using models to help identify effective and proportionate measures
for health sector and whole-of-society responses.
What a way to welcome our new head of school, <a href="https://twitter.com/enenbee">Nancy
Baxter</a>!</p>
<p>There's been a huge amount of work done to date, by an ever-expanding network
of collaborators.
It has been genuinely rewarding to play a role in national and international
efforts to respond to COVID-19, but it's also been extremely stressful and
exhausting.
And it's been terrifying to be intimately aware that my work is feeding into
decision-making at the highest levels of government in the midst of an
emerging global crisis.
I am keenly looking forward to the day where our physical distancing measures
have been relaxed and, in the company of close friends, I can look back at
this time as something that happened to all of us.</p>

    <p>Last night I gave a talk about <em>Mathematical models of infectious disease
transmission</em> (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/robmoss/talk-2019-02-mmsm/">slides</a>) at
the
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/The-Melbourne-Maths-and-Science-Meetup/events/258523294/">Melbourne Maths and Science Meetup</a>.
I used my <a href="https://robmoss.github.io/sir-demo/">stochastic SIR demo</a>
to simulate disease outbreaks amongst the audience ‚Äî each audience member
was assigned a unique number and had to stand up while they were infectious
‚Äî and it's definitely something I'd like to try in a classroom setting.
I was asked very good and challenging questions throughout the talk, and on
several occasions my reply was &quot;that's a great question, and I'll talk about
that a bit later on&quot;.
It was a fun night and a chance to meet some great people!
Now I'm looking forward to being in the audience at their next event.</p>

    <p>A steadily-increasing number of students and postdocs in our group find
themselves needing to run huge numbers of model simulations, and the path of
least resistance ‚Äî using their local desktop or laptop ‚Äî simply isn't
feasible.
Thankfully we have the <a href="https://nectar.org.au/research-cloud/">Nectar Cloud</a>
at our disposal!
I've been helping several people in our group transition to this platform, and
this has prompted me to prepare several step-by-step tutorial for the
different needs I've encountered so far.
It's my intention to make these all available online, and the first cab off
the rank is: How to create a MATLAB VM.</p>

    <p>This semester I'm co-lecturing Declarative Programming (COMP90048). The topics I'll be covering include monads, laziness, performance, and type system expressiveness, with <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> as our language of choice. This will be the first time that I'll try live coding in front of students, because I've previously lectured non-programming subjects such as multi-variable calculus and infectious disease modelling.</p>
<p>The obvious choice of tool for live demonstrations of Haskell code and expression evaluation is <code>ghci</code>. And I happen to have <code>ghci</code> already installed, by virtue of using <a href="http://xmonad.org/">xmonad</a> to manage my windows and workspaces. I also spend most of my working hours living in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, which has great support for working with interactive programming environments (also referred to as REPLs, Read-Eval-Print Loops) and for taking code blocks from open files and evaluating them in these environments. So I know what my preferred tools are. But it wasn't immediately clear to me what the precise <em>workflow</em> should be.</p>

    <p><em>&quot;It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future&quot;</em> ‚Äî this
<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/10/20/no-predict/">famous quote</a> is a
great opening line when discussing infectious disease forecasting.
I used it in my talk at the Australian Influenza Symposium (1-2 Nov 2017), as
did a speaker in an earlier session.
And there are <em>many reasons</em> why infectious disease forecasting is hard.
There isn't a single-biggest roadblock to making accurate epidemic forecasts,
and I was recently quoted about this very matter in &quot;<a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/51042/">How Bad Will the Flu
Season Get? Forecasters Are Competing to Figure it
Out</a>&quot; (<em>The
Scientist</em>, 28 Nov 2017).</p>
<p>I really enjoy the challenge of engaging with non-academic audiences, both as
an end in itself, and also because it should help me improve my grant writing.
And this isn't my first experience with the media.
I've previously been quoted in articles about the link between climate and
influenza transmission (<a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/climate/hot-and-wet-or-cold-and-dry-both-boost-flu-in-the-tropics">Flu outbreaks are subject to humidity ‚Äî not just
heat</a>,
<em>Cosmos</em>, 1 Nov 2016), and our collaboration with the Victorian Department of
Health and Human Services (<a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/defence-scientists-bio-attack-detector-could-predict-flu-outbreaks/news-story/129411a1edf0aa01fcb84c0ecf088bb4">Defence scientists' bio attack detector could

    <p>Infectious disease forecasting has been a very active research area in the
past few years, and these methods have the potential to provide valuable
decision-support capabilities for public health staff.
There are many challenges that must be surmounted before this can be realised,
and one major gap in the literature is operational research in pilot,
real-world applications.
We report on exactly this kind of study in our most recent forecasting paper,
&quot;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.12750">Epidemic forecasts as a tool for public health: interpretation and
(re)calibration</a>&quot;, which has just
been made available online and will appear in an upcoming issue of the
<em>Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health</em>.</p>
