    <p>In &quot;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002521">The Layer-Oriented
Approach to Declarative Languages for Biological Modeling</a>&quot;, Raikov and De
Schutter propose a &quot;layer-oriented&quot; declarative language to map high-level
biological concepts to computational representations. The layer-oriented
approach was chosen because &quot;<em>additional functionality can be transparently
added to the language by adding more layers</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>This is an area that has interested me ever since I began my PhD.
Domain-specific languages are a very neat way to express computational problems
in a manner that (hopefully) captures the essentials of the problem domain with
a minimum of noise. And declarative languages (e.g., logic languages such as
Prolog and <a href="http://www.mercurylang.org/">Mercury</a>, and
functional languages such as <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> and
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/">OCaml</a>) are more readily able to
express the logic of a problem without (overly) digressing into the algorithmic
details of solving the problem.</p>
<p>I suppose my biggest concern with the layer-oriented approach is that an
extension to the language is presumably constrained by the existing
layers—a layer can only be added between two existing layers, or at the
top or bottom of the entire collection of layers. Thus, the choice of a core
set of layers would set fixed constraints on the concerns and the levels of
abstraction that an extension could possibly support. Of course, if a more
traditional Computer Science approach were taken (e.g., a core language and
syntactical extensions such as macros), then extensions would necessarily be
orthogonal and so constrained by the underlying language. At least, that's my
gut feeling.</p>
<p>In more practical terms, my exposure to the word of ontologies (spanning
physiology, biology, chemistry and physics) has given me a much greater
appreciation for the scope of <em>model documentation</em> and how such
documentation can be precisely defined and referenced. In my opinion, it would
be a great development for models to be presented with their parameter values
(or sets of parameter values) associated not only with ontological terms
(providing definitions that span different notations and presentations), but
also with references to the source data, review articles and modelling papers
from which the values were derived, fitted or compared against. This would be
a way of publishing a vast amount of the grunt-work that goes into developing
and analysing a model, in a concise and machine-readable format.</p>
<p>All in all, I think this is an idea that certainly needs to be given broad
consideration in the biological modelling world. By taking what little Computer
Science can offer (beyond farming large-scale computation to experienced
programmers and large multi-core systems), hopefully future biological models
can more clearly and succinctly communicate not only the &quot;<em>how</em>&quot;, but
also the &quot;<em>what</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>why</em>&quot;.</p>
